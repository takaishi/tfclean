# tfclean

tfclean is a tool for cleaning up Terraform configuration files by automatically removing applied moved, import, and removed blocks. This helps maintain clean and readable Terraform configurations by eliminating blocks that have already served their purpose.

## Installation

### Using Homebrew

```bash
brew tap takaishi/tap
brew install takaishi/tap/tfclean
```

### Using go install

```bash
go install github.com/takaishi/tfclean/cmd/tfclean
```

### Using aqua

[aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/) is a declarative CLI Version Manager. You can install tfclean using aqua:

```bash
aqua g -i takaishi/tfclean
```

Or add to your `aqua.yaml`:

```yaml
registries:
  - type: standard
    ref: v4.292.0 # renovate: depName=aquaproj/aqua-registry
packages:
  - name: takaishi/tfclean@v0.7.0  # Use the latest version
```

Then run:

```bash
aqua i
```

### Using Nix

```bash
# Using nix run (no installation required)
nix run github:takaishi/tfclean -- /path/to/tffiles

# Install globally with Nix flakes
nix profile install github:takaishi/tfclean

# Add to your system configuration or home-manager
# In your flake.nix inputs:
inputs.tfclean.url = "github:takaishi/tfclean";
# Then add to your packages: inputs.tfclean.packages.${system}.default
```

### Using GitHub Actions

You can use the official GitHub Action to install tfclean in your workflows:

```yaml
- uses: takaishi/tfclean@v1
  with:
    version: 'latest' # Optional, defaults to latest
```

### Manual Installation

Download the appropriate binary for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/takaishi/tfclean/releases).

## Usage

### Remove All Blocks

Remove all moved/import/removed blocks regardless of their state:

```bash
tfclean /path/to/tffiles
```

### Remove Only Applied Blocks

Remove only the blocks that have been successfully applied (requires access to tfstate):

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=your_profile tfclean --tfstate s3://path/to/tfstate /path/to/tffiles
```

## Features

- **Smart Block Removal**
  - [x] Removes moved blocks that have been applied
  - [x] Removes import blocks that have been applied
  - [x] Removes removed blocks that have been applied
  - [x] Option to forcefully remove all moved/import/removed blocks

- **Platform Support**
  - Supports both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures
  - Available for Linux and macOS

## GitHub Actions Integration

You can automate the cleanup of your Terraform configurations using GitHub Actions. Here's a complete example that creates pull requests for cleanup:

```yaml
name: tfclean

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  pull-requests: write # Required for creating pull requests

jobs:
  tfclean:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Setup GitHub App token for PR creation
      - uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
        id: app-token
        with:
          app-id: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      
      # Configure AWS credentials if using remote state
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: "aws_role_arn_for_oidc"
          aws-region: "ap-northeast-1"
      
      # Install and run tfclean
      - uses: takaishi/tfclean@v1
      
      # Create PR if changes detected
      - name: Check changes
        id: diff-check
        run: git diff --exit-code || echo "changes_detected=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      
      - name: Create Pull Request
        if: steps.diff-check.outputs.changes_detected == 'true'
        run: |
          branch_name=tfclean_$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M")
          git switch -c ${branch_name}
          git config --global user.email "bot@example.com"
          git config --global user.name "Terraform Cleanup Bot"
          git add .
          git commit -m "chore: auto-remove applied terraform blocks"
          git push origin ${branch_name}
          gh pr create --base main --head ${branch_name} --title "Auto-remove applied Terraform blocks" --body "This PR removes Terraform blocks that have been successfully applied."
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
```

This workflow will:
1. Run on pushes to the main branch
2. Install and run tfclean
3. Create a pull request if any blocks were removed
4. Use GitHub App authentication for better security

For the GitHub Actions integration, it's recommended to use a GitHub App for authentication instead of personal access tokens. This provides better security and more granular permissions control.
